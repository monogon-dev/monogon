// KLogParser returns an io.WriteCloser to which raw logging from a klog emitter
// can be piped. It will attempt to parse all lines from this log as
// glog/klog-style entries, and pass them over to a LeveledLogger as if they were
// emitted locally.
//
// This allows for piping in external processes that emit klog logging into a
// logtree, leading to niceties like transparently exposing the log severity or
// source file/line.
//
// One caveat, however, is that V-leveled logs will not be translated
// appropriately - anything that the klog-emitter pumps out as Info will be
// directly ingested as Info logging. There is no way to work around this.
//
// Another important limitation is that any written line is interpreted as having
// happened recently (ie. within one hour of the time of execution of this
// function). This is important as klog/glog-formatted loglines don't have a year
// attached, so we have to infer it based on the current timestamp (note: parsed
// lines do not necessarily have their year aleays equal to the current year, as
// the code handles the edge case of parsing a line from the end of a previous
// year at the beginning of the next).
