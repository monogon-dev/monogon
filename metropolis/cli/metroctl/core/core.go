// Package core contains parts of metroctl which do significant amounts of work
// beyond just providing a CLI for them.
// This package is intended to be used for integrating with functions provided
// by metroctl, for example for using them in integration tests or writing other
// frontends providing functionality similar to metroctl (like a GUI or webapp).
