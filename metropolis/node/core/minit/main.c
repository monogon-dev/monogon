// minit is a barebones Linux-compatible init (PID 1) process.
//
// Its goal is to run the Metropolis core executable and reap any children that
// it stumbles upon. It does not support running under a TTY and is not
// configurable in any way.
//
// The only reason this exists is because Go's child process reaping (when
// using os/exec.Command) races any PID 1 process reaping, thereby preventing
// running a complex Go binary as PID 1. In the future this might be rewritten
// in a memory-safe language like Zig or Rust, but this implementation will do
// for now, as long as it keeps having basically zero attack surface.
//
// This code has been vaguely inspired by github.com/Yelp/dumb-init and
// github.com/krallin/tini, two already existing minimal init implementations.
// These, however, attempt to handle being run in a TTY and some
// configurability, as they're meant to be run in containers. We don't need any
// of that, and we'd rather have as little C as possible.
