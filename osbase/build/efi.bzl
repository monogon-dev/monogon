                List of payloads to concatenate and supply as the initrd parameter to Linux when it boots.
                The name stems from the time Linux booted from an initial ram disk (initrd), but it's now
                a catch-all for a bunch of different larger payload for early Linux initialization.

                In Linux 5.15 this can first contain an arbitrary amount of uncompressed cpio archives
                with directories being optional which is accessed by earlycpio. This is used for both
                early microcode loading and ACPI table overrides. This can then be followed by an arbitrary
                amount of compressed cpio archives (even with different compression methods) which will
                together make up the initramfs. The initramfs is only booted into if it contains either
                /init or whatever file is specified as init= in cmdline. Technically depending on kernel
                flags you might be able to supply an actual initrd, i.e. an image of a disk loaded into
                RAM, but that has been deprecated for nearly 2 decades and should really not be used.

                For kernels designed to run on physical machines this should at least contain microcode,
                optionally followed by a compressed initramfs. For kernels only used in virtualized
                setups the microcode can be left out and if no initramfs is needed this option can
                be omitted completely.
